## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Download the appropriate zip file from [Ekko Releases](https://github.com/soheltarir/ekko/releases) link. Extract the 
zip file in a directory location of your choosing.

## ðŸ›  Configuration

The Ekko binary reads configuration from the `config.yaml` file which should reside in the same folder as that of the
binary/executable. By default, the release package comes pre-configured with a `config.yaml` which you could change as per your
requirements.

## ðŸª€ Usage

### MacOS

1. [Open a terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac) and go 
the directory where you extracted the zip file; `cd <YourInstallDirectory>/ekko`
2. Ekko requires super admin privileges to run, hence run the program using `sudo ./ekko`
3. Press `control` and `C` to close the program or quit the terminal window.

### Linux
1. Open a terminal and go the directory where you extracted the zip file; `cd <YourInstallDirectory>/ekko`
2. Ekko requires super admin privileges to run, hence run the program using `sudo ./ekko`
3. Press `Ctrl` and `C` to close the program or quit the terminal window.

### Windows
1. Go the folder where the zip file is extracted using Windows Explorer.
2. Right click `ekko.exe`, and select "Run as Administrator".

## Logs
Network statistics UI and file logs are enabled by default (which you could configure on your in the `config.yaml` file).
The file logs reside in the `logs` folder in the directory wherein the package is extracted. You would find logs files
generated therein; **results.ndjson** stores network statistics for pings generated and **debug.ndjson** stores 
application debug logs.

The log output is in newline-delimited JSON format (learn more here: http://ndjson.org/), upon which you could generate
metrics later on to trigger alerts or create historical dashboards to track network performance of the destinations configured.
